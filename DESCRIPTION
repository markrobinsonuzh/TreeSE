Description: This package provides classes to support interactive data
          aggregation and visualization of genomic datasets with hierarchies. The `TreeIndex` class 
          provides methods to manage hierarchy as tree and split the tree at a given level or at
          a given node selection thats spans across levels. The `TreeSE` class extends `SummarizedExperiment` 
          and performs aggregations where either rowData or colData or both can be a 
          hierarchy (a `TreeIndex` class).
